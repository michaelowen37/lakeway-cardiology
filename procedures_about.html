      <strong>Echocardiogram:</strong> <br>
      This is an ultrasound of the heart with an emphasis on structure and function.  We look at the chambers, muscles, valves, blood flow and more in order to answer a clinical question.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):</strong> <br>
      The is a rapid snapshot of your heart's electrical activity (at rest) by means of electrodes and leads.  These are typically performed when visiting your PCP or cardiologist or when you need clearance for surgery.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Holter Monitor:</strong> <br>
      Unlike the resting ECG which grabs a snapshot of the heart's electrical activity at one point in time, a holter monitor records continuously.  This is typically prescribed in 3, 7 and 14 day intervals but some exceptions apply.   
      <br><br>
      <strong>Stress Exercise Test:</strong> <br>
      This is a treadmill test designed to evaluate the heart while under stress.  When the heart is under high demand, the health of the coronary arteries becomes more appreciable.  We will gradually increase the speed and incline of the treadmill every 3 minutes and evaluate things like exercise tolerance, blood pressure response, electical changes, metabolic equivalents and whether or not the exertion-induced symptoms are replicable.  Most people only need to walk between 5 and 12 minutes in order to achieve the necessary targets.  When preparing, no need to stop any medications.  Just be sure to wear comfortable clothing, shoes you can walk in and fast for two hours prior.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Stress Echocardiogram:</strong> <br>
      A stress echocardiogram involves everything seen under the "standard stress test" section but it also adds ultrasound to the mix.  By viewing the heart with ultrasound before and after the treadmill portion of the stress test, we benefit from additional data which can carry some influence over the final interpretation.  There is a fairly high chance the patient will need an IV and contrast administration (Definity) with this test.  This offers the best possible quality when trying to evaluate the function of the left ventricle post-stress.  However, for some, it is not required.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Nuclear Medicine Stress Test:</strong> <br>
      This is another method of evaluating the heart when it's under stress but without requiring a treadmill. These tests can be performed with a treadmill or with a safe pharmacological drug designed to increase your heart rate and induce an environment similar to that of physical exertion.  Then, while the heart is working hard, the perfusion of the heart muscle is evaluated through imaging.  An intravenous radioactive substance is required for the imaging portion of the test.  This type of test might be a better option for those who are not likely to reach their target heart rate on a treadmill.  
      <br><br>
      <strong>Dobutamine (pharmacological) Stress Test:</strong> <br>
      Similar to the Nuclear Medicine stress test but without the intravenous radioactive substance.  Instead of nuclear imaging, ultrasound would be used instead.  A safe pharmacological drug, aimed at increasing your heart rate and inducing an environment similar to that of physical exertion, is used as an alternative to walking on a treadmill.  This can be handy for evaluating the severity of aortic stenosis in a low-flow state.  
      <br><br>
      <strong>Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE):</strong> <br>
      This is an ultrasound of the heart that utilizes a probe long enough to run down the esophagus.  This is commonly ordered with cardioversions for the purpose of evaluating the left atrial appendage but also necessary for answering various clinical questions and assisting physicians during surgery. 
      <br><br>
      <strong>Coronary CTA:</strong> <br>
      This is a CT scan of the heart that uses a contrast dye to accurately assess the health of the coronary arteries.  This is a great alternative to an angiogram (an invasive test performed in a cath lab for evaluating the coronary arteries, placing stents, measuring pulmonary pressures and more) in many cases.  The appeal comes from it's high degree of accuracy without the requirement of sedation.  It's less invasive but if positive, might require the patient to still get an angiogram.  Both tests require an intravenous contrast dye.  
      <br><br>
      <strong>Calcium Scoring CT:</strong> <br>
      This is a CT scan that does not require a contrast dye and is used to identify and quantify the presence of calcium deposits within the heart.  <br>Note: Not all atherosclerosis is calcified so soft plaques will not be seen.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Cardiac MRI:</strong> <br>
      A cardiac MRI is a non-invasive test that uses a powerful magnet to create detailed images of your heart. It allows doctors to see the structure and function of your heart, including the chambers, blood vessels, and other surrounding tissues.  This can be done with or without contrast dye.
